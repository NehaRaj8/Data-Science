## R Markdown

```{r load the package}
library(tidyverse)

```


## List of patients who were admitted in 2018
```{r - Load the data}
data <- read_csv("Cancer related admission.csv")


```
## Now upload the population_demographic csv
```{r}
getwd()
data1<-read_csv("population_demographics.csv")
data2 <- read_csv("pop_demo_data_dictionary.csv")
glimpse(data1)
```
## checking the data1 for missing value and outliers
```{r}
data1 %>% summary()
```

After checking the value in data 1 it seems the maximum age is  150 which seems not right

```{r}
data1$age %>% table()
```
# so there are 125 entries with age 150 which can be considered not correct.
```{r}

data1$deprivation %>% table()
```
